# Project Status Update: Mistral and Whisper Setup

Date: March 22, 2025

## Overview

This document provides a status update on the deployment of Mistral 7b on Ollama and Whisper on Triton Inference Server.

## Deployment Status

### Mistral 7b on Ollama
- **Status**: Successfully deployed
- **Location**: Running in Kubernetes namespace `ollama`
- **Functionality**: Model is operational and can be accessed via the Ollama API

### Whisper on Triton
- **Status**: Partially deployed, troubleshooting in progress
- **Location**: Kubernetes namespace `triton-inference`
- **Current Issues**: Working through model loading challenges

## Triton Server Details

- Triton server is running successfully in Kubernetes
- Health check endpoint is responding with 200 OK status
- Server is accessible via ports:
  - HTTP: 8000
  - gRPC: 8001 
  - Metrics: 8002
- GPU support is properly configured

## Technical Challenges

We've encountered some challenges with the Whisper model on Triton:

1. Initial model configuration was attempting to use an ONNX model, but the model file was not valid
2. We've created multiple approaches to resolve this issue:
   - Using the identity backend for a pass-through model
   - Generating a simple ONNX model to match the expected input/output configuration
   - Modifying Triton configuration to use different model types

3. Current error when loading the model:
```
Internal: onnx runtime error 1: Load model from /models/triton/models/whisper/1/model.onnx failed:
ModelProto does not have a graph.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term fixes**:
   - Create a properly formatted ONNX model for Whisper
   - Test with a known working example model first to validate the Triton setup
   - Review file permissions and model directory structure

2. **Medium-term plan**:
   - Once the model is loading correctly, implement proper inference endpoints
   - Set up integration between Whisper and Mistral for a complete workflow
   - Create documentation for API usage

3. **Testing strategy**:
   - Validate model loading with Triton's model repository API
   - Test inference with sample audio files
   - Benchmark performance with different batch sizes

## Scripts and Configuration Files

During this process, we've created several utility scripts:
- `create-dummy-onnx.py`: Generates a simple ONNX model
- `deploy-dummy-onnx.sh`: Deploys the generated model to Triton
- `fix-whisper-identity.sh`, `final-fix-whisper.sh`: Various approaches to fix model loading
- Configuration files in `configs/triton/whisper/`

## Conclusion

The Mistral 7b model on Ollama is working as expected. For the Whisper model on Triton, we're making progress on resolving the model loading issues. The Triton server itself is running correctly, and we expect to have a working Whisper model soon after addressing the ONNX model format issues.
